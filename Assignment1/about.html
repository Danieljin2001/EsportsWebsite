                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In February 2019, the SK Telecom T1 organization announced that it was rebranding to T1. However, their League of Legends team could not rebrand mid-year, and remained as SKT for the remainder of the 2019 season, through Worlds. In November, CEO Joe Marsh began referring to the League of Legends team under the name T1.</p>
                <h2>2019 Season</h2>
                <p>On November 17th T1 announced the contract extension of Faker. During the following days, the departures of their coaching staff around star coach kkOma and experienced players Khan, Clid, Haru and Mata were made public. In the same week, KZ jungler Cuzz joined the team and the contract of support Effort was extended as well. A week later T1 completed their roster with the signings of Gen.G top lane substitute Roach and Damwon's coach Kim who lead iG to the S8 World Championship. Additionally trainees Canna, Ellim, Gumayushi and Kuri were promoted to substitute positions.</p>
                <h2>2020 Season</h2>
                <p>During 2019 LoL KeSPA Cup T1 barely scraped past the new roster of Gen.G before being clearly defeated by SANDBOX Gaming's upgraded roster. After being upset by HLE during week 1 of LCK Spring Split the team went on a convincing clean winning streak beating the other top teams DragonX and Gen.G during which Canna managed to secure himself the starting spot in the top lane before being defeated by Afreeca Freecs. Unfazed by this loss, the unexpected mid-season break due to the 2019â€“20 Coronavirus Pandemic, the change to online play, and their coaches announcement to try other playstyles during the second half of the split T1 continued with 5 wins including ones again both matches against DragonX and GEN.G. A wild end to the Regular Season with messy victories and clear defeats to Damwon and KT Rolster raised some concerns about the team's level of play going into playoffs. Thanks to the help of APK Prince on the last matchday T1 got to wait in the semifinals as they held the H2H against DragonX. The latter became their opponents in the semifinals but lead by rookie top laner Canna destroying his lane opponent T1 managed to win pretty comfortably 3-1. Back in LoL Park for the Finals against first seed Gen.G they came in well prepared and dominated the match completely for a 3-0 sweep and their 9th LCK title.</p>
